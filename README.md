# Black box gradient optimizer

This is the most basic gradient descent code you will have ever seen. The reason, why I wrote this is very simple. Sometimes it is not possible to find the exact gradient for a function and in such cases, we can estimate the gradient by the first principle and use it to find the gradient.
